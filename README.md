## Notes

One challenge I had was trying to debug javascript. I used JSFiddle as a scratchpad to test code, functions, and methods to get a sense of how to use them.

Second Challenge I had was creating an element to append with Javascript. The error i was getting was that the element had not been created yet. As an alternate method I used the existing html element and did a .innerhtml += template in order to add in the necessary components.
